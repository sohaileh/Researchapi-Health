In this Table, provisional cases of selected infrequently reported notifiable diseases (&lt;1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed.  This tables excludes U.S. territories.</p>\n<p>Note:<br />\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistic web page (<a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html\">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html</a>). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.  Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/\">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/</a>. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html\">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html</a>.</p>\n<p>Footnote:<br />\n—: No reported cases.

Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case counts for reporting years 2017 and 2018 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2013 through 2016 are finalized.

With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2013 have been variant influenza viruses.</p>\n<p>¶¶ Prior to 2018, cases of paratyphoid fever were included with salmonellosis cases (see Table II).</p>\n<p>*** Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers'. NNDSS was updated beginning in 2015 to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>This data contains provisional counts for drug overdose deaths based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.</p>\n<p>The provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.</p>\n<p>Several data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.</p>\n<p>Technical notes</p>\n<p>Nature and sources of data</p>\n<p>Provisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).</p>\n<p>The timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.</p>\n<p>Provisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. The 12-month ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. Counts for the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year are shown for comparison. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12-month ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation. Methods to adjust provisional counts have been developed to provide predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths, accounting for delayed reporting (see Percentage of records pending investigation and Adjustments for delayed reporting).</p>\n<p>Provisional data are based on available records that meet certain data quality criteria at the time of analysis and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Therefore, they should not be considered comparable with final data and are subject to change.</p>\n<p>Cause-of-death classification and definition of drug deaths<br />\nMortality statistics are compiled in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regulations on use of the classification. Causes of death for data presented in this report were coded according to ICD guidelines described in annual issues of Part 2a of the NCHS Instruction Manual (2).</p>\n<p>Drug overdose deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes from the Tenth Revision of ICD (ICD–10): X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), and Y10–Y14 (undetermined). Drug overdose deaths involving selected drug categories are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes. Drug categories presented include: heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics, including morphine and codeine, and semisynthetic opioids, including drugs such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone (T40.2); methadone, a synthetic opioid (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone, including drugs such as fentanyl and tramadol (T40.4); cocaine (T40.5); and psychostimulants with abuse potential, which includes methamphetamine (T43.6). Opioid overdose deaths are identified by the presence of any of the following MCOD codes: opium (T40.0); heroin (T40.1); natural opioid analgesics (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioid analgesics other than methadone (T40.4); or other and unspecified narcotics (T40.6). This latter category includes drug overdose deaths where ‘opioid’ is reported without more specific information to assign a more specific ICD–10 code (T40.0–T40.4) (3,4). Among deaths with an underlying cause of drug overdose, the percentage with at least one drug or drug class specified is defined as that with at least one ICD–10 multiple cause-of-death code in the range T36–T50.8.</p>\n<p>Drug overdose deaths may involve multiple drugs; therefore, a single death might be included in more than one category when describing the number of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs. For example, a death that involved both heroin and fentanyl would be included in both the number of drug overdose deaths involving heroin and the number of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone.</p>\n<p>Selection of specific states and other jurisdictions to report<br />\nProvisional counts are presented by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred (i.e., the reporting jurisdiction). Data quality and timeliness for drug overdose deaths vary by reporting jurisdiction. Provisional counts are presented for reporting jurisdictions based on measures of data quality: the percentage of records where the manner of death is listed as “pending investigation,” the overall completeness of the data, and the percentage of drug overdose death records with specific drugs or drug classes recorded. These criteria are defined below.</p>\n<p>Percentage of records pending investigation</p>\n<p>Drug overdose deaths often require lengthy investigations, and death certificates may be initially filed with a manner of death “pending investigation” and/or with a preliminary or unknown cause of death. When the percentage of records reported as “pending investigation” is high for a given jurisdiction, the number of drug overdose deaths is likely to be underestimated. For jurisdictions reporting fewer than 1% of records as “pending investigation”, the provisional number of drug overdose deaths occurring in the fourth quarter of 2015 was approximately 5% lower than the final count of drug overdose deaths occurring in that same time period. For jurisdictions reporting greater than 1% of records as “pending investigation” the provisional counts of drug overdose deaths may underestimate the final count of drug overdose deaths by as much as 30%. Thus, jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if 1% or fewer of their records in NVSS are reported as “pending investigation,” following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Values for records pending investigation are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.</p>\n<p>Percent completeness</p>\n<p>NCHS receives monthly counts of the estimated number of deaths from each jurisdictional vital registration offices (referred to as “control counts”). This number represents the best estimate of how many deaths occurred in a given jurisdiction in each month. Death records in the NVSS database must have both demographic and coded cause-of-death information. The percent completeness is obtained by dividing the number of death records in the NVSS database for each jurisdiction for each 12-month period by the control counts and multiplying by 100. For more information on completeness, see Technical Notes of the Vital Statistics Rapid Release Program. Jurisdictions are included in Table 2 if the percent completeness was consistently 90% or higher following a 6-month lag for the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard.</p>\n<p>Drug specificity</p>\n<p>The percentage of death records in which a specific drug or drug class is identified as involved in a drug overdose death varies by jurisdiction (5). Selected jurisdictions consistently had 90% or more of drug overdose death certificates mentioning at least one specific drug for all of the 12-month ending periods included in the dashboard. Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths where a specific drug or drug class is reported on the death certificate are presented for the United States and for jurisdictions meeting this threshold. Additionally, as a data quality metric, the percentage of drug overdose death records where at least one drug or drug class is recorded is presented.</p>\n<p>As the timeliness and data quality of the drug overdose mortality data improve, the list of included jurisdictions will be re-examined to determine whether additional jurisdictions should be included or excluded based on the criteria described above. Due to reporting variations by jurisdiction, comparisons across selected jurisdictions should not be made. Data quality measures are shown for all jurisdictions in the below table. Values are updated with each monthly release and reflect the most current data available.</p>\n<p>Adjustments for delayed reporting</p>\n<p>Provisional counts of drug overdose deaths are underestimated relative to final counts. The degree of underestimation is determined primarily by the percentage of records with the manner of death reported as “pending investigation” and tends to vary by reporting jurisdiction, year, and month of death. Specifically, the number of drug overdose deaths will be underestimated to a larger extent in jurisdictions with higher percentages of records reported as “pending investigation,” and this percentage tends to be higher in more recent months.</p>\n<p>Methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays related to temporal factors (i.e., 12 month-ending period) and the percentage of records that are reported with manner of death “pending investigation.” Briefly, these methods involve developing ‘multiplication factors’ based on the degree of underreporting in provisional data compared with final data. For example, if provisional counts of drug overdose deaths were historically 90% complete relative to final data, then the multiplication factor in this instance would be 1.1.  The reported provisional counts can be multiplied by this factor to generate a set of predicted provisional counts that adjust for reporting delays.</p>\n<p>The 12 month-ending period and the percentage of records with manner of death reported as “pending investigation” were used to predict the degree of underreporting in provisional data relative to final.  Results from these models were used to generate a set of multiplication factors that could be applied to the reported provisional counts of drug overdose deaths to estimate predicted provisional counts.  These predicted provisional counts may represent a more accurate picture of recent trends by accounting for reporting delays related to the percentage of records in provisional data with manner of death “pending investigation.” It is important to note that flat or declining numbers of drug overdose deaths (either reported or predicted) could be due to incomplete data, true decreases in the number of deaths, or a combination of the two. True declines or plateaus in the numbers of drug overdose deaths across the U.S. cannot be ascertained until final data become available.</p>\n<p>Source: NCHS, National Vital Statistics System.

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from BRFSS, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, risk factor and state. BRFSS is a system of telephone surveys conducted by CDC that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year across 50 states, the District of Columbia, and three U.S. territories. BRFSS data for VEHSS includes one question from the core component related to Visual Function. Data were suppressed for cell sizes less than 30 persons, or where the relative standard error more than 30% of the mean. Data will be updated as it becomes available. Detailed information on VEHSS BRFSS analyses can be found on the VEHSS BRFSS webpage (link). General information about BRFSS can be found on the BRFSS website (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/brfss\">https://www.cdc.gov/brfss</a>). The VEHSS BRFSS dataset was last updated in June 2018.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is a computerized information database designed to support the FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program for all approved drug and therapeutic biologic products. The FDA uses AERS to monitor for new adverse events and medication errors that might occur with these marketed products. Reporting of adverse events from the point of care is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products' manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools. A simple search of AERS data cannot be performed with these files by persons who are not familiar with creation of relational databases.</p>\n",

Data are provisional and are subject to monthly reporting variation. National data are calculated by summing the number of events reported by state of residence; counts are rounded to the nearest thousand (births and deaths) or hundred (infant deaths). Provisional counts may differ by approximately 2% from final counts, due to rounding and reporting variation. Additionally, the accuracy of the provisional counts may change over time.

State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System.  YRBSS Data. The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12).  The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation. The logit transformation constrains confidence interval limits to vary between a lower limit of 0% and an upper limit of 100%.   The data for the STATE System were extracted from YRBSS surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, and smokeless tobacco products prevalence.</p>\n",

This report updates previous systematic reviews of the health IT literature, focusing specifically on identifying and summarizing the evidence related to the use of health IT as outlined in the Meaningful Use regulations. The review examined the literature to determine the article authors' findings related to the effects or associations of a meaningful use functionality on an aspect of care. Each article's findings was scored as positive (defined as: health IT improved key aspect of care but none worse off), mixed-positive (defined as: positive effects of health IT outweight negative effects), neutral (defined as: health IT not associated with change in outcome), or negative (defined as: negative effects of health IT on outcome). The full review data: article, related meaningful use functionality, aspect of care, and author sentiment are provided in this dataset.</p>\n",

There are 62 unique RECs across the United States. This data set provides county-level health care professional participation in the REC Program. You can track metrics on the total primary care and non-primary care providers that signed up for REC assistance, gone live with an EHR, and demonstrated meaningful use of certified EHR technology.

Market share approximations are determined through an analysis of the certified health IT products reported by participants in the Medicare EHR Incentive Program from 2011 to 2016. Approximations use the most recently reported data for each unique clinician and hospital participant. It is important to understand how to interpret these approximations. Some clinicians and hospitals report certified software from more than one unique developer. The market share percentages in this dataset, therefore, include some double counting (the percentages will, if summed together, add up above 100 percent.) The approximations convey the percent of hospitals and clinicians who use a developer's technology, and are not to be interpreted in aggregate as the percent of all hospitals and clinicians who have access to 2015 edition certified technology.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>This data set contains estimated teen birth rates for age group 15–19 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15–19) by county and year.</p>\n<p>DEFINITIONS</p>\n<p>Estimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15–19 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15–19) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates “borrow strength” across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information—including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables—to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.<br />\nMedian teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15–19 for counties in a state.<br />\nBayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.</p>\n<p>NOTES</p>\n<p>Data on the number of live births for women aged 15–19 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003–2015 (5).</p>\n<p>Population estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.</p>\n<p>Hierarchical Bayesian space–time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003–2015 (1,2,3,4).</p>\n<p>The Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-α)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector θ and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space Ф such that<br />\n1-α≤P({C│y})=∫p{θ │y}dθ,<br />\nwhere integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of θ.  The probability that θ lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- α) (6).</p>\n<p>County borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003–2015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003–2015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005–2007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).</p>\n<p>SOURCES</p>\n<p>National Center for Health Statistics.

            "description": "<p>This dataset contains model-based county estimates for drug-poisoning mortality.</p>\n<p>Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).</p>\n<p>Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.</p>\n<p>Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.</p>\n<p>Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).</p>\n<p>REFERENCES<br />\n1.

HRQOL surveillance is used to identify unmet population health needs including recognizing trends, disparities, and determinants of health in the population. HRQOL surveillance data can be used to inform decision making, and program and policy development. To assure that the population is benefiting from public health programs, HRQOL surveillance data can be used for program evaluation. A compact set of HRQOL measures including a summary measure of unhealthy days have been developed and validated for population health surveillance and have been widely used since 1993.</p>\n",

Data include state-level information on Medicaid coverage of approved medications by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for tobacco cessation treatment; types of counseling recommended by the Public Health Service (PHS) and barriers to accessing cessation treatment. Note: Section 2502 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires all state Medicaid programs to cover all FDA-approved tobacco cessation medications as of January 1, 2014. However, states are currently in the process of modifying their coverage to come into compliance with this requirement. Data in the STATE System on Medicaid coverage of tobacco cessation medications reflect evidence of coverage that is found in documentable sources, and may not yet reflect medications covered under this requirement.</p>\n",

In this Table, provisional cases of selected infrequently reported notifiable diseases (&lt;1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed.</p>\n<p>Note:<br />\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting.</p>\n<p>Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.</p>\n<p>Footnote:<br />\n—: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NA: Not available. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Case counts for reporting year 2017 are provisional and subject to change. Data for years 2012 through 2016 are finalized. For further information on interpretation of these data, see <a href=\"http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf\">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesS...</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>† This table does not include cases from the U.S. territories. Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, are in Table II to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>§ Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. Additional information is available at <a href=\"http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf\">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p>¶ Updated weekly reports from the Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II.</p>\n<p>** Not reportable in all jurisdictions. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table, except for the arboviral diseases and influenza-associated pediatric mortality. Reporting exceptions are available at <a href=\"http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html\">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html</a>.</p>\n<p>†† Data for Haemophilus influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II.</p>\n<p>§§ In 2016, the nationally notifiable condition ‘Hepatitis B Perinatal Infection’ was renamed to ‘Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection’ and reflects updates in the 2016 CSTE position statement for Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection.</p>\n<p>¶¶ Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.</p>\n<p>*** Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition.</p>\n<p>††† Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II.</p>\n<p>§§§ Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses.  With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2011 have been variant influenza viruses.  Total case counts are provided by the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).</p>\n<p>¶¶¶ Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.</p>\n<p>**** Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers\". Beginning in 2015, NNDSS has been updated to receive data for each of the viral hemorrhagic fevers listed below. In addition to the four cases of Ebola diagnosed in the United States to date in 2014, six residents of the United States have been medically evacuated to the United States for care after developing Ebola in West Africa. Ten of the 11 VHF cases reported for 2014 are confirmed as Ebola and one as Lassa fever.</p>\n<p>††††The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists approved position statement 16-ID-01 in June 2016, which modifies the previous case definition and naming convention from \"Zika virus congenital infection\" to \"Zika virus disease, non-congenital”.</p>\n",

The YTS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in middle schools (grades 6–8) and high schools (grades 9–12).  The data for the STATE System were extracted from Youth Tobacco Surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking prevalence, cigarette smoking frequency, smokeless tobacco products prevalence and quit attempts.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning.</p>\n<p>Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).</p>\n<p>Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.</p>\n<p>Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.</p>\n<p>REFERENCES<br />\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

            "description": "<p>This is the complete dataset for the 500 Cities project 2017 release. This dataset includes 2015, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release. More information about the methodology can be found at <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/500cities\">www.cdc.gov/500cities</a>.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).</p>\n<p>Data are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.</p>\n<p>Causes of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.</p>\n<p>SOURCES</p>\n<p>CDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm\">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm</a>); and CDC WONDER (see <a href=\"http://wonder.cdc.gov\">http://wonder.cdc.gov</a>).</p>\n<p>REFERENCES</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>National Center for Health Statistics.

The small area estimation model and code were correct. This data discrepancy only affected the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates on the Socrata open data file, the GIS-friendly data file, and the 500 Cities online application.

This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates. More information about the methodology can be found at <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/500cities\">www.cdc.gov/500cities</a>.<br />\nNote: During the process of uploading the 2015 estimates, CDC found a data discrepancy in the published 500 Cities data for the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates caused when reformatting the SAS data file to the open data format. . The small area estimation model and code were correct. This data discrepancy only affected the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates on the Socrata open data file, the GIS-friendly data file, and the 500 Cities online application. The other obesity estimates (city-level age-adjusted and tract-level) and the Mapbooks were not affected. No other measures were affected. The correct estimates are update in this dataset on October 25, 2017.</p>\n",

The Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System is intended   to provide population estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care.

Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.

            "description": "<p>This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. and state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.</p>\n<p>Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).</p>\n<p>Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.</p>\n<p>Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.</p>\n<p>Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.</p>\n<p>Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).</p>\n",

The National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) was created to assess the prevalence of tobacco use, as well as the factors promoting and impeding tobacco use among adults. NATS also establishes a comprehensive framework for evaluating both the national and state-specific tobacco control programs.  NATS was designed as a stratified, national, landline, and cell phone survey of non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older residing in the 50 states or D.C. It was developed to yield data representative and comparable at both national and state levels. The sample design also aims to provide national estimates for subgroups defined by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.</p>\n",

Many state statutes and regulations authorize and define the use of electronic health information (EHI). Practitioners often criticize these laws as complex and contradictory and point to them as barriers to using EHI. Attorney researchers used WestlawNext to search for EHI-related statutes and regulations of the US states, US<br />\nterritories, and the District of Columbia in effect as of January 2014. The researchers independently catalogued provisions by the EHI use described in the law.

These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.</p>\n<p>Potentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.</p>\n<p>Not all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.</p>\n<p>Mortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System.

The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample (NIS) is part of a family of databases and software tools developed for the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient health care database in the United States, yielding national estimates of hospital inpatient stays. Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by indicator, and they include CVDs (e.g., heart failure). The data can be plotted as trends and stratified by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the county level by selected demographic characteristics and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015.</p>\n<p>Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).</p>\n<p>Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.</p>\n<p>Estimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.</p>\n<p>Death rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.</p>\n<p>Smoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).</p>\n",

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting.</p>\n<p>Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.</p>\n<p>“Symbols and footnotes changed in week #4, please refer to the MMWR publication for the symbols/footnotes for weeks 1, 2, and 3”.</p>\n<p>Footnote:<br />\n-: No reported cases    N: Not reportable    NA: Not available NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.

GHPSS is a standardized school-based survey of third-year students pursuing advanced degrees in dentistry, medicine, nursing, or pharmacy. It is conducted in schools during regular class sessions. GHPSS follows an anonymous, self-administered format for data collection. GHPSS uses a core questionnaire on demographics, prevalence of cigarette smoking and other tobacco use, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco use, exposure to secondhand smoke, desire for smoking cessation, and training received regarding patient counseling on smoking cessation techniques. Questionnaires are translated into local languages as needed. GHPSS has a standardized methodology for selecting participating schools and classes and uniform data processing procedures.</p>\n",

The Selected Metropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) project uses the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to analyze the data of selected counties with 500 or more respondents. BRFSS data can be used to identify emerging health problems, establish and track health objectives, and develop and evaluate public health policies and programs. BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. Data will be updated annually as it becomes available.

The BRFSS is a continuous, state-based surveillance system that collects information about modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases and other leading causes of death. The data for the STATE System were extracted from the annual BRFSS surveys from participating states.  Tobacco topics included are cigarette smoking status, cigarette smoking prevalence by demographics, cigarette smoking frequency, and quit attempts.  NOTE:  these data are not to be compared with BRFSS data collected 2011 and forward, as the methodologies were changed.  Please refer to the FAQs / Methodology sections for more details.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\". Please visit the Tracking homepage for this information.View additional information for indicator definitions and documentation by selecting Content Area \"Air Quality\" and the respective indicator at the following website: <a href=\"http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showIndicatorsData.action\">http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showIndicatorsData.action</a></p>\n",

Babesiosis to Coccidioidomycosis - 2014.In this Table, provisional cases of selected notifiable diseases (≥1,000 cases reported during the preceding year), and selected low frequency diseases are displayed. The Table includes total number of cases reported in the United States, by region and by states, in accordance with the current method of displaying MMWR data.  Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Case counts for reporting year 2014 are provisional and subject to change.

Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths climbed slowly from a rate of 521.0 per 100,000 in 2001 to 615.7 per 100,000 in 2005.  The rates then dipped to 595.1 per 100,000 in 2006 and 566.7 per 100,000 in 2007.  The rates then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010 to a rate of 823.7 per 100,000.  Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.  In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.  TBI-related deaths also decreased slightly over time from 18.5 per 100,000 in 2001 to 17.1 per 100,000 in 2010.

Shifts in observed prevalence from 2010 to 2011 for BRFSS measures will likely reflect the new methods of measuring risk factors, rather than true trends in risk-factor prevalence. A break in trend lines after 2010 is used to reflect this change in methodolgy. Percentages are weighted to population characteristics. Data are not available if it did not meet BRFSS stability requirements.For more information on these requirements, as well as risk factors and calculated variables, see the Technical Documents and Survey Data for a specific year - <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm.Recommended\">http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm.Recommended</a> citation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in collaboration with the United Nations' UNICEF, UNESCO, and UNAIDS; and with technical assistance from CDC.  The GSHS is a school-based survey conducted primarily among students aged 13-17 years in countries around the world.  It uses core questionnaire modules that address the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among children and adults worldwide: 1) Alcohol use, 2) dietary behaviors, 3) drug use, 4) hygiene, 5) mental health, 6) physical activity, 7) protective factors, 8) sexual behaviors that contribute to HIV infection, other sexually-transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancy, 9) tobacco use, and 10) violence and unintentional injury.  This dataset contains global data from 2003 – 2015.  Additional information about the GSHS can be found at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/gshs/index.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/gshs/index.htm</a>.</p>\n",

This dataset is a de-identified summary table of vision and eye health data indicators from NHANES, stratified by all available combinations of age group, race/ethnicity, gender, and risk factor. NHANES is a program of studies conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at CDC designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the U.S, and combines interviews and physical examinations. NHANES stopped collecting vision and eye health data in 2008. Approximate sample size is 5,000 persons per year. NHANES data for VEHSS includes questions and examinations related to Visual Function, Vision Exam Measures, Eye Health Conditions, Service Utilization, and Examination Measures. Data were suppressed for cell sizes less than 30 persons, or where the relative standard error more than 30% of the mean. Data will be updated as it becomes available. Detailed information on VEHSS NHANES analyses can be found on the VEHSS NHANES webpage (link). Additional information about NHANES can be found on the NHANES website (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm</a>). The VEHSS NHANES dataset was last updated in June 2018.</p>\n",

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting.</p>\n<p>Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.</p>\n<p>Footnote:<br />\n-: No reported cases    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.<br />\n* Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions.<br />\n† Case counts for reporting years 2014 and 2015 are provisional and subject to change.

            "description": "<p>In general, total combined rates for traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and deaths have increased over the past decade.  Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths climbed slowly from a rate of 521.0 per 100,000 in 2001 to 615.7 per 100,000 in 2005.  The rates then dipped to 595.1 per 100,000 in 2006 and 566.7 per 100,000 in 2007.  The rates then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010 to a rate of 823.7 per 100,000.</p>\n<p>Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.  In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.  TBI-related deaths also decreased slightly over time from 18.5 per 100,000 in 2001 to 17.1 per 100,000 in 2010.  Note that the axis scale for TBI-related deaths appears to the right of the chart and differs from TBI-related hospitalizations and ED visits.</p>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/data/index.html\">http://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/data/index.html</a> to view more TBI data &amp; statistics.</p>\n",

Shifts in observed prevalence from 2010 to 2011 for BRFSS measures will likely reflect the new methods of measuring risk factors, rather than true trends in risk-factor prevalence. A break in trend lines after 2010 is used to reflect this change in methodolgy. Percentages are weighted to population characteristics. Data are not available if it did not meet BRFSS stability requirements. For more information on these requirements, as well as risk factors and calculated variables, see the Technical Documents and Survey Data for a specific year - <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm\">http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm</a>.

Results are integrated and annotated in the searchable genomics database that also provides access to a variety of software packages, analytic pipelines, online resources, and web-based tools to facilitate analysis and interpretation of large-scale genomic data. Data are available as defined by the NIA Genomics of Alzheimer’s Disease Sharing Policy and the NIH Genomics Data Sharing Policy. Investigators return secondary analysis data to the database in keeping with the NIAGADS Data Distribution Agreement.</p>\n",

The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.<br />\nNHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.<br />\nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).<br />\nWhile the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.</p>\n",

This fact sheet focuses on data reported in a recent U.S. Census Bureau report, Custodial Mothers and Fathers and Their Child Support: 2011. The data reported are estimated based on a biennial survey of custodial parents, the Child Support Supplement to the Current Population Survey, March/April 2012, co-sponsored by the Office of Child Support Enforcement.  The proportion of custodial parents living below poverty line continues to increase in 2011. The report found that 4.2 million custodial parents lived in poverty in 2011, representing 29 percent of all custodial parents, about twice the poverty rate for the total population. These statistics reinforce the essential role that child support services can play in helping low-income families, especially during an economic downturn.</p>\n",

NITRC collects and points to standardized information about tools, making the task of finding and comparing them easier than before. The site can help researchers find the right functional or structural neuroimaging tool or resource for their research. NITRC has recently added services such as cloud-based computing and data storage, and is broadening the range of scientific domains from MR to PET, SPECT, CT, MEG/EEG and optical imaging. Additional domains of interest are digital atlasing, and computational neuroscience, including large-scale and multi-scale modeling. The NITRC team searches out relevant research tools and resources to house on the site. Researchers can compare tools on NITRC and developers can seek and receive help from the community to make their tools more usable and accessible.</p>\n",

The goal of this resource is to establish a curated nanomaterial registry, whose primary function is to provide consistent information on the biological and environmental interactions of well-characterized nanomaterials, as well as links to associated publications, modeling tools, computational results and manufacturing guidances. The publicly available Registry is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource for the nanomaterial community, providing data that has been systematically curated based on minimal information standards built with broad community acceptance. It provides a way to tie together different sources of information for a specific nanomaterial and allows users to search and compare characteristic data on different nanomaterials.</p>\n<p>The registry provides tools for analyzing and comparing data on the biological and environmental implications of well-characterized nanomaterials. This resource will evolve as the quality and quantity of the information on nanomaterials improve. Hundreds of nanomaterial entries have been curated into the registry for physico-chemical characteristics and are available to the public. Biological and environmental study data for existing nanomaterial entries will also be curated into the registry.</p>\n<p>The nanomaterial registry provides the following functions for the research community: basic and advance search through key words or physical and chemical characteristics (PCC); ability to browse nanomaterials based on categories; detailed information about PCC and the biological, and environmental interactions of nanomaterials; display the quality of the characterization of each nanomaterial entry in the form of compliance level that is algorithm based; compare PCC and the biological and environmental interactions of nanomaterials; and find similar nanomaterials based on PCC and the biological and environmental interactions of nanomaterials.</p>\n",

These tables are available here for both the Household Component and the Insurance Component.<br />\nHousehold Component Summary Tables<br />\nThe Household Component summary tables provide frequently used summary estimates at the national level on household medical utilization and expenditures: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical care services, charges and payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. Some of these tables can be customized online. State-level estimates of household medical utilization and expenditures are also provided for selected states. Insurance Component Summary Tables<br />\nThe Insurance Component summary tables provide estimates at the national, state, and metro area levels on employer-based health insurance: number and types of insurance plans, premiums, benefits, contributions by employers and employees, and employer characteristics. Please note, in preparation for improvements in the data collection process, 2007 data for the Insurance Component was not collected.<br />\nMEPS employer-based health insurance tables are produced in the year following data collection. Private-sector tables are posted in July; government and civilian tables are posted in November. National-level tables: Private sector estimates by firm size, industry group, census regions and other characteristics; public sector data by state and local government types, government size, and census division; civilian estimates that incorporate both the private and state and local government sectors; national totals for enrollees and cost of health insurance coverage for both the private and public sectors. State and metro area tables: State-level estimates for the private sector by firm size, industry groupings, ownership type, age of firm, employee characteristics, and average wage quartiles. Metropolitan area private sector estimates of premiums, employee contributions, enrollments, and take-up rates by firm size.</p>\n",

During the household interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. The panel design of the survey, which features several rounds of interviewing covering two full calendar years, makes it possible to determine how changes in respondents' health status, income, employment, eligibility for public and private insurance coverage, use of services, and payment for care are related. The HC expenditures have been projected to future years by selected demographic characteristics by source of payment and type of service. HC data are available on the MEPS Web site in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level).  Public Use Files are available.</p>\n",

PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''Âµg/m''Â³), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''Âµg/m''Â³)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.</p>\n",

Temperature data are available in Fahrenheit or Celsius scales. Reported measures are the average temperature, number of observations, and range for the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, and also percent coverage for the daily maximum heat index. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified maximum and minimum air temperature, and heat index value. The data are derived from the North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) through NLDAS Phase 2, a collaboration project among several groups: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Princeton University, the National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Hydrological Development (OHD), the University of Washington, and the NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program/Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center/ Universities Space Research Association developed the analysis to produce the data available on CDC WONDER.</p>\n",

PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''Âµg/m''Â³), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''Âµg/m''Â³)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.</p>\n",

Data for 22 variables are included in the data set, including:  age groups, race / ethnicity, sex, vital status, year reported, state, metropolitan area, several patient risk factors, directly observed therapy, disease verification criteria and multi-drug resistant TB.   Each year these data are updated with an additional year of cases plus revisions to cases reported in previous years.   OTIS is produced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP).</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>Overview: The QuitNowTXT text messaging program is designed as a resource that can be adapted to specific contexts including those outside the United States and in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''¢ Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''¢ Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''¢ Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''¢ Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''¢ Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.</p>\n",

The State Snapshots include summary measures of quality of care and States' performances relative to all States, the region, and best performing States by overall health care quality, types of care (preventive, acute, and chronic), settings of care (hospitals, ambulatory care, nursing home, and home health), and clinical conditions (cancer, diabetes, heart disease, maternal and child health, and respiratory diseases). Special focus areas on diabetes, asthma, Healthy People 2010, clinical preventive services, disparities, payer, and variation over time are also featured.

The Survey has been conducted approximately every four years since 1977. For each survey year, HRSA has prepared two Public Use File databases in flat ASCII file format without delimiters. The 2008 data are also offerred in SAS and SPSS formats. Information likely to point to an individual in a sparsely-populated county has been withheld. General Public Use Files are State-based and provide information on nurses without identifying the County and Metropolitan Area in which they live or work.  County Public Use Files provide most, but not all, the same information on the nurse from the General Public Use File, and also identifies the County and Metropolitan Areas in which the nurses live or work. NSSRN data are to be used for research purposes only and may not be used in any manner to identify individual respondents.</p>\n",

TOXMAP helps users create nationwide, regional, or local area maps showing where TRI chemicals are released on-site into the air, water, and ground. It also provides facility and release details, color-codes release amounts for a single year or year range, and aggregates release data over multiple years. Maps also show locations of Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) sites, listing all chemical contaminants present at these sites.  Two versions of TOXMAP are available: the classic version of TOXMAP released in 2004, and a new version of TOXMAP based on Adobe® Flash/Flex technology.  The new version provides an improved map appearance and interactive capabilities and additional datasets such as EPA coal plant emissions data and U.S. commercial nuclear power plants.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to combat obesity, heart disease, and cancer are major components of the Community Health Data Initiative.  This dataset provides key health indicators for local communities and encourages dialogue about actions that can be taken to improve community health (e.g., obesity, heart disease, cancer). The CHSI report and dataset was designed not only for public health professionals but also for members of the community who are interested in the health of their community. The CHSI report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. Although CHSI presents indicators like deaths due to heart disease and cancer, it is imperative to understand that behavioral factors such as obesity, tobacco use, diet, physical activity, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior and others substantially contribute to these deaths.</p>\n",
